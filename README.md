This project aims to examine the relationship between life expectancy and factors such as Adult Mortality Rate, Percentage of alcohol consumption per 1000 people, Immunization (Polio & Hepatitis B), GDP, Schooling and more. 

The 2 main questions being answered in this analysis are as follows: Which factor(s) should be given priority in facilitating an increase in future life expectancy? How significant is the difference in life expectancy between developed and developing countries? The findings from this analysis will help in highlighting the aspects a country should focus on to generate an increase in the life expectancy of its population. 

The dataset used for this analysis is the World Health Organization (WHO) Life Expectancy Dataset which takes into consideration all previously stated factors within a time period of the years 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries. In an effort to efficiently answer the research questions above, Histograms, Scatter Plots, Bar charts, Line Plots, Box Plots and a Correlation Matrix Heatmap were utilized for visualization purposes. Linear regression and Machine learning models were used for predictive modelling. This analysis was conducted using the python environment.
