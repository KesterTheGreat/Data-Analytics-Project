The 4 main questions being answered in this analysis are as follows: Which factor played the biggest role in the gradual increase in life expectancy? How strong is the impact of immunization on life expectancy? Can we determine the individual factor which contributed the most to a lower life expectancy? Does schooling have a stronger relationship with life expectancy in developing countries? 

The findings from this analysis will help in highlighting the aspects a country should focus on to generate an increase in the life expectancy of its population. The dataset being used is the World Health Organization (WHO) Life Expectancy Dataset which takes into consideration all previously stated factors within a time period of the years 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries.  

In this project machine learning models such as, the multiple regression model and a correlation matrix as well as visual distributions will be utilized to successfully and efficiently answer the questions above. This analysis will be conducted using the R Studio environment.
